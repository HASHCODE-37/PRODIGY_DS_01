# Prodigy_Python_Task01
This is the Task 01 i got from "Prodigy InfoTech" As Intern. i used Matplotlib in Python to perfom this task. i hope it will help you in your work.

Histogram for Age Distribution
Description
This Python script generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages in a population. It utilizes the Matplotlib library to create the plot.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Matplotlib library
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from python.org.

Install the Matplotlib library using pip:

Copy code
pip install matplotlib
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (age_distribution_histogram.py).

Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python age_distribution_histogram.py
The script will generate a histogram displaying the distribution of ages in a population.

Customization
You can modify the ages array in the script to use your own data for visualization.
Adjust the number of bins (bins parameter) in the plt.hist() function for finer or coarser granularity in the histogram.
